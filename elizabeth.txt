Elizabeth II (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; 21 April 1926 â€“ 8 September 2022) was Queen of the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms from 6 February 1952 until her death in 2022. 
She was queen regnant of 32 sovereign states during her lifetime and 15 at the time of her death.[a] 
Her reign of 70 years and 214 days was the longest of any British monarch and the longest verified reign of any female sovereign in history.

Elizabeth was born in Mayfair, London, as the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother).
 Her father acceded to the throne in 1936 upon the abdication of his brother King Edward VIII, making Princess Elizabeth the heir presumptive. 
She was educated privately at home and began to undertake public duties during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In November 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, and their marriage lasted 73 years until his death in 2021.
 They had four children: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward.
